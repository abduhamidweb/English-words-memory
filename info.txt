make me a flash card using html css and javascript. that is, there will be one modal window. that modal window should have input tags for the English word and input tags for its translation. when it is submitted, the values ​​should be taken and stored in an array. then put that array into cards and render it on the page. There should be a translation word between the rendered card. when you click on the translation card, the card should rotate and say the word English. There should be a voice icon under that English word. When you click on the voice icon, it should read that English word. When you click on the translation card, the card should return to its original position.
